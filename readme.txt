You can find question statement inside each assignment by the name "question.pdf" and the zip file corresponding to each question you may use to practice.

These are the assignments and additional problems solved by me during the tenure of the course COL100: Introduction to Computer Science under Prof. Prem Kalra.

Use this for all fair means.
